# Failed Strategies: Volatility and Mean Reversion Approaches

## Strategy 1: Bollinger Band Mean Reversion
### Performance Metrics
- **Win Rate:** 16.7%
- **Return:** -32.99%
- **Sharpe Ratio:** -7.22
- **Status:** FAILED ❌

## Strategy 2: Volatility Squeeze
### Performance Metrics

- Inability to capture market reversal points
- Significant capital erosion

### Volatility-Based Strategies
- Extreme negative Sharpe ratios
- Low win rates (13.5-16.7%)
