## Research Streams

### Mean Reversion Strategies
**Focus Areas:**
1. **Bollinger Band Reversals**
   - Identify price extremes
   - Confirm with volume
   - Tight vs. wide band analysis

2. **RSI Oversold/Overbought**
   - Traditional RSI thresholds (30/70)
   - Extended range analysis
   - Confluence with other indicators

3. **Price Extremes + Volume Confirmation**
   - Identify price outliers
   - Validate with volume spikes
   - Multi-timeframe analysis

### Volatility-Based Approaches
**Focus Areas:**
1. **ATR Expansion/Contraction**
   - Identify volatility regime changes
   - Trade breakouts and mean reversion
   - Dynamic position sizing based on volatility

2. **Volatility Breakouts**
   - Detect sudden volatility increases
   - Trend following vs. mean reversion
   - Volatility clustering analysis

3. **Range Compression Trades**
   - Identify periods of low volatility
   - Predict potential breakout direction
   - Tight stop management

## Multi-Indicator Combination Research
**Approach:**
- Rapid testing of indicator combinations
- Quick iteration and validation
- Explore synergies between different signals

## General Research Guidelines
- Use FREE data sources only
- Extensive backtesting required
- Document ALL findings, including failures
- Iterate and refine approaches rapidly

## Reporting Requirements
- Update every 10-15 minutes
- Detailed documentation of approach
- Clear performance metrics
- Immediate failure documentation

## Next Steps
1. Develop research hypotheses
2. Create backtesting frameworks
3. Validate strategies
4. Rapid iteration and refinement
