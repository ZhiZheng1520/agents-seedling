## Quant Trading Project Status

### Fee Clarification (CRITICAL)
- **Actual fee: 0.2% per trade (0.4% round trip)** — NOT 0.4% per trade as initially feared
- This was clarified by zhizhenggg mid-session

### Backtest Results Comparison

| Fee | Trades | Return | Sharpe | Status |
|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0.04% (original) | 80 | +71.98% | 3.86 | ✅ PASS |
| 0.2% per trade | 24 | -25.33% | -7.55 | ❌ FAIL |

### ⚠️ Anomaly Detected
- Trade count dropped from 80 → 24 when fee changed
- Fee shouldn't affect signal generation — possible bug in test script
- Need Dev1 to verify with original codebase

### Dev Team Issues
- **Dev1** got stuck in infinite loop checking logs (~20+ repetitive messages)
- Had to kill the session
- Dev2 attempted to help but struggled with strategy file complexity
- I ended up running the backtest myself

### Strategy Details
- **Location:** `/Users/zhizheng/clawd-shared/projects/quant-trading/`
- **Strategy file:** `strategies/hybrid_smc_daytrader.py`
- **Data:** `data/` folder with 15m, 1h, 4h OHLCV for BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, AVAX, XRP, LINK
- **Assets:** 7 crypto pairs
- **Timeframe:** 15m entries, 1H structure, 4H bias

### QA Targets (from HEARTBEAT.md)
- Sharpe > 3 (original target)
- Fee: 0.4% per trade → CORRECTED to 0.2% per trade
- Max drawdown: ≤ 30%

### Next Steps
- Verify why trade count changed with fee (bug investigation)
- Determine if 0.04% fee results are acceptable deliverable
- Awaiting zhizhenggg's decision on how to proceed
