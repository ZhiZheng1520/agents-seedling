# 2026-01-30 - Manager Session Log

## Morning Status (05:14 GMT+8)

### Task Assignment - Quant Trading Bug Investigation
Assigned critical bug investigation to the developer team:

**Issue:** Trade count anomaly in backtest results
- Original (0.04% fee): 80 trades, +71.98% return
- Updated (0.2% fee): 24 trades, -25.33% return
- Fee parameter shouldn't affect trade count → likely a bug

**Assignments:**
- **Dev1:** Lead investigation, identify root cause, share plan first
- **Dev2:** Backup/review role, help with fix once bug is identified
- **QA:** Monitor and verify final results against targets

**Key instruction from zhizhenggg:** Always remind team to plan before executing tasks to avoid yesterday's infinite loop situation.

### Team Communication
- Posted task assignment in #developer-team channel
- Used @ mentions to alert specific agents
- Emphasized planning before execution

## Status Check (05:29 GMT+8)

zhizhenggg asked me to "continue" - checking on team progress:

**Team Status:**
- Dev1: Restarted, hasn't begun investigation yet
- Dev2: Polling a process "nova-shore" (unclear if related to bug)
- QA: Tried to set up cron monitoring (failed), waiting for guidance

**Action Taken:**
Posted status check message in #developer-team asking:
- Dev1: Share investigation plan
- Dev2: Clarify what you're working on
- QA: Stand by for verification (no automated monitoring needed)

Reminded team: "Plan → Share → Execute. No loops!"

---

## Next Steps
- Wait for team responses
- Monitor progress
- Provide guidance as needed

---

## Strategy Research Pivot (05:48 GMT+8)

**New directive from zhizhenggg:**
- Continuously iterate on strategies until we meet requirements:
  - Sharpe > 3.0
  - Max DD < 30%
  - 0.4% round trip fees
- Research alternative indicators: liquidation heatmaps, order flow, on-chain metrics
- Keep testing different combinations/parameters

**Team assignments:**
- Dev1: Bug fix + liquidation heatmap research
- Dev2: Order flow indicators & APIs
- Dev3: On-chain metrics & funding rates
- QA: Document & backtest

---

## Failure Documentation Process (06:03 GMT+8)

**Critical process update:**
- When a strategy fails, document it immediately via Secretary
- Prevents repeating mistakes
- Creates knowledge base of "what doesn't work"
- Team must report failures with: strategy name, parameters, results, why it failed
- Manager coordinates with Secretary for logging

---

## Team Status Report (06:13 GMT+8)

**Reported to zhizhenggg:**
- Both FREE strategies failed completely:
  1. Volume Delta: -23.8%, Sharpe -2.14
  2. Funding Rates: -99.4%, Sharpe -3.42 (catastrophic)
- Team exhausted viable free-data approaches
- Dev2 recommended escalation: targets may not be achievable with free data
- Options: lower targets, approve paid data ($100-500/mo), or try basic strategies
- Secretary documented all failures
- Team on standby for next direction

---

## Rally Mode Activated (06:15 GMT+8)

**Boss directive:** "Don't stop. Keep researching. Add skills from ClawdHub."

**Actions taken:**
1. ✅ Rallied team - continuous iteration mode, no stopping
2. ✅ Searched ClawdHub for relevant skills
3. ✅ Installed 3 new skills:
   - **Quiver** - Congress trading, insider transactions, lobbying data
   - **Financial Market Analysis** - Yahoo Finance + sentiment analysis
   - **Alpha Finder** - Prediction market intelligence (Polymarket/Kalshi)

**New research directions:**
- Mean reversion strategies (Bollinger, RSI, price extremes)
- Volatility-based (ATR expansion/contraction)
- Multi-indicator combinations
- Alternative data signals (Congress trades, insider transactions)
- Sentiment + technical combos

**Team status:** Active testing mode, fast iteration

## Strategy Testing Results (06:15 - 22:35 GMT+8)

**Tested 7 strategies:**

**Failures (5):**
1. Volume Delta: -23.8%, Sharpe -2.14, WR ~25%
2. Funding Rates: -99.4%, Sharpe -3.42, WR 25.3%
3. BB Bounce: -32.99%, Sharpe -7.22, WR 16.7%, DD -34.56%
4. Multi-indicator momentum: -87%
5. Another momentum: -97%

**Considerable (1):**
6. **SMA Crossover (10/30, RSI>40, Vol>1.2x)** — BEST RESULT
   - Initial: 10 trades, WR 40%, Sharpe 3.32 ✅, DD -4.94% ✅, Return +6.53%
   - Optimized (5/26, RSI>30, Vol>1.1x): 23 trades, WR 39.1%, Sharpe 3.49 ✅, DD -9.78% ✅, Return +16.03%
   - **Status:** Passes 2/3 targets (Sharpe + DD), flagged as "considerable"
   - **Issue:** Win rate 39.1% vs target 50%

**Currently Testing (1):**
7. Bollinger Band mean reversion variations

**Key Findings:**
- First strategy to pass Sharpe + DD targets
- Win rate ceiling appears to be ~40% with current approaches
- 21 parameter combos found that meet Sharpe+DD, all have ~40% WR
- Team documenting all failures to avoid repeats
- Boss instructed: continue until ALL 3 targets met
