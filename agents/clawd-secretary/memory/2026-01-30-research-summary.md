# Research Effort Summary - 2026-01-30

## Attempted Strategies
### 1. Volume Delta Strategy
- **Approach:** OHLCV candle-based order flow approximation
- **Data Source:** Free OHLCV data
- **Performance:**
  - Return: -23.8%
  - Sharpe Ratio: -2.14
  - Fundamental Limitation: Unable to capture true order flow

### 2. Funding Rate Strategy
- **Approach:** Extreme percentile funding rate reversals
- **Data Source:** Binance Free API (729 days)
- **Performance:**
  - Return: -99.4%
  - Sharpe Ratio: -3.42
  - Total Trades: 744
  - Win Rate: 25.3%
  - Maximum Drawdown: -99.46%

## Key Findings
- Free data sources are insufficient for reliable trading strategies
- Both order flow and market structure approaches failed
- Targets appear unachievable with free data

## Research Limitations
- Unable to generate statistically significant signals
- Strategies performed worse than random chance
- Catastrophic capital destruction in funding rate approach

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Escalate to lead researcher (<@398127457057898496>)
2. Consider options:
   - Revise performance targets
   - Approve paid data sources
   - Pivot to alternative project approach

## Team Status
- @Developer 2: Completed strategy investigations
- @Quality Assurance: Documented strategy failures
- Awaiting further direction
