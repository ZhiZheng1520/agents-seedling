# 2026-01-29 — First Day as Developer1

## Bootstrap
- Created as **Developer1** 🛠️ — coding-focused assistant
- User: **Zhi** (zhizhenggg on Discord)
- Workspace: `~/clawd-dev1`

## Multi-Agent Setup Fixed
Helped Zhi debug why Manager bot wasn't responding:

### Issues Found & Fixed
1. **Manager groupPolicy was "allowlist"** → changed to "open" so it responds without @mentions
2. **Manager's Anthropic token was expired** → copied valid auth from dev1's `auth-profiles.json`
3. **Dev1 couldn't receive bot messages** → added `allowBots: true` to my Discord config

### Current Agent Config
- 6 agents: manager, clawd, dev1, dev2, qa, secretary
- Each bound to different Discord accounts
- Manager & dev1 have `groupPolicy: "open"` and `allowBots: true`
- Others still use `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` (require @mention)

### Bot-to-Bot Communication
- Manager can now message me via Discord @mention
- I can receive and respond to Manager's messages
- Working cross-bot communication in `#general` channel

## Key Config Paths
- Main config: `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json`
- Agent auth: `~/.clawdbot/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json`
- Agent sessions: `~/.clawdbot/agents/<agentId>/sessions/`
- Logs: `/tmp/clawdbot/clawdbot-YYYY-MM-DD.log`

## Team Onboarding Complete
Full 6-agent team now operational:
- **Manager** <@1466321157236981783> — coordination & oversight
- **Dev1** <@1466321529028476928> — coding (me!)
- **Dev2** <@1466321677070762044> — coding
- **QA** <@1466322177379926038> — testing & quality
- **Secretary** <@1466321949159457003> — organization & scheduling
- **Clawd** (WhatsApp only) — main assistant

**Key rule:** Always use @mentions when talking to other agents in Discord!

## Model Policy Change (late night)
Zhi updated model assignments:
- Manager, QA, Secretary → Ollama `qwen3-vl:8b` (local, free)
- Dev1, Dev2 → Haiku (primary)
- Coding agent skill → Sonnet or Haiku only, NO Opus
- All agents must plan tasks by phases before executing
- Always use @mentions

## Clawd WhatsApp Auth Fix
Same issue as Manager — clawd's `anthropic:claude-cli` token was expired. Fixed by copying dev1's valid token.

## Notes
- Multiple bots in same channel need @mentions to route correctly
- `allowBots: true` required for bot-to-bot communication
- Auth profiles are per-agent — copy if needed, don't share agentDir
- **OAuth tokens expire!** If an agent gets HTTP 401 errors, check its auth-profiles.json
