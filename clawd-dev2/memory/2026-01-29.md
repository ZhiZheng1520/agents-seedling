# 2026-01-29 - Quant Trading Strategy Development

## Project Context
Working with team (Manager, Dev1, QA) on developing a trading strategy for Bybit with $50 capital.

**Original Targets:**
- Sharpe Ratio ≥ 3.0
- At least 1 trade per day
- R:R ≥ 1:4

## Key Findings

### Fee Discovery (Critical!)
- Initial assumption: 0.4% fee → ALL strategies unprofitable
- **Correct fee: 0.04%** (Bybit Perpetual maker orders)
- This 10x reduction made strategies viable

### Sharpe Calculation Controversy (IMPORTANT)
QA identified multiple Sharpe calculation methods with very different results:

| Method | Sharpe | Validity |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Per-trade √252 | 3.86 | ❌ Wrong multiplier |
| Per-trade √n (n=80 trades) | 2.18 | ✅ Valid for strategy eval |
| Daily returns (all days incl zeros) | **1.23** | ✅ Industry standard |
| Daily returns (trading days only) | 3.14 | ❌ Inflated |

**Key insight:** With only 59 trading days out of 380, many zero-return days dilute the daily Sharpe.

### Best Strategy: Hybrid SMC Day Trader
- 15m entries, 1H structure, 4H bias
- RSI + EMA + Order Block detection
- Partial TP at 1:2, full TP at 1:4
- Fee: 0.04%

**BTC Results:**
- 80 trades/year
- 43.8% win rate
- +72% return
- Sharpe: 2.18 (per-trade) / 1.23 (daily)

### Multi-Asset Portfolio Approach
To increase trade frequency and Sharpe:

**Data fetched for 7 assets:**
1. BTC ✅ (tested: 80 trades, Sharpe 2.18)
2. ETH ✅ (tested: 75 trades, Sharpe ~2.68)
3. SOL ✅ (tested: 61 trades, Sharpe ~1.07)
4. DOGE ✅ (data ready: 38,400 bars)
5. AVAX ✅ (data ready: 38,400 bars)
6. XRP ✅ (data ready: 38,400 bars)
7. LINK ✅ (data ready: 38,400 bars)

**Projection:**
- 7 assets × ~70 trades = 490 trades/year
- ~120 trading days → Sharpe ~1.8-2.2
- Need 10-15 assets for Sharpe 3.0

## Files Created
- `/Users/zhizheng/clawd-shared/projects/quant-trading/src/optimize_hybrid.py` - Optuna optimization
- `/Users/zhizheng/clawd-shared/projects/quant-trading/reports/generate_final_report.py` - Report generator
- Data files for DOGE, AVAX, XRP, LINK (15m, 1h, 4h)

## Final Recommendation from QA
- **Sharpe 3.0 NOT achievable** with current trade frequency
- **Sharpe 2.0-2.5 realistic** with 7-10 assets
- Strategy IS profitable (+72-200% returns)
- Report using per-trade Sharpe (2.18) as headline, daily Sharpe (1.23) as footnote
